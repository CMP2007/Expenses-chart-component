## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In this project I suffered from several setbacks since I did not do any planning before starting work, which caused me to omit the pop-up text boxes, thus producing a considerable delay in restructuring the already made code to be able to incorporate them into the design.

Therefore, this practice reminds me of the importance of taking the time to analyze and plan the activity that is about to be carried out, thus avoiding delays or wasting the work already done.

### Continued development
At this moment I want to continue doing challenges and practices based on HTML, CSS and JS to develop a good foundation before continuing with my learning path.
